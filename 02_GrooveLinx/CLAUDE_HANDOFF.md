# GrooveLinx AI Handoff

_Last updated: 2026-03-30 (Rehearsal Intelligence + GLInsights + GrooveMate Coach — unified guided Home)_

## Read This First

This file is the shortest trustworthy briefing for any new AI session.

Canonical GrooveLinx project docs live in:
```text
~/Documents/GitHub/deadcetera/02_GrooveLinx
```

If memory conflicts with repo docs, **repo docs win**.

## Project Identity

GrooveLinx is a **Band Operating System** for practice, rehearsal, setlist building, and live performance.

Three modes: 🔥 Sharpen (personal), 🎯 Lock In (band), 🎤 Play (live).
Band Feed is the central action hub. Listening Bundles are the fastest path to hearing.
**GrooveMate** is the contextual guide avatar (Fan → Bandmate → Coach).

## Architecture

- **Vanilla JavaScript SPA** — no frameworks, no build tools
- **Firebase Realtime Database** — backend/persistence
- **Vercel** — hosting, auto-deploy on push to main
- **Cloudflare Worker** — API proxy (Claude, Spotify, YouTube, Archive)
- **GitHub Actions** — JS syntax validation + auto version stamping
- **Production URL**: https://app.groovelinx.com

## Current State (2026-03-25)

### Unified Player Engine (GLPlayerEngine + GLPlayerUI)
- State machine: IDLE → LOADING → RESOLVING → PLAYING → FALLBACK → ERROR
- Mixed sources per song: YouTube, Spotify (SDK or embed), Archive
- Auto-fallback chain: preferred → Spotify → YouTube → Archive (configurable)
- Per-play token guards against rapid-tap race conditions
- 4-second terminal state guarantee (PLAYING or FALLBACK)
- Three UI modes: overlay (full-screen), float (mini over charts), bar (now-playing)
- Completion screen: reflection + streak + band signal + next actions
- Chart sync: `ChartSystem.highlightActiveSong()` on song change

### Spotify Web Playback SDK
- `gl-spotify-player.js` — dedicated subsystem
- States: IDLE → LOADING_SDK → CONNECTING → READY → PLAYING → PAUSED → REQUIRES_INTERACTION → ERROR → UNAVAILABLE
- Creates "GrooveLinx" device in Spotify Connect
- Scopes: `streaming`, `user-read-playback-state`, `user-modify-playback-state` (+ existing)
- Graceful fallback: SDK → embed iframe → external open
- iOS: explicit "Tap play to start" CTA

### GrooveMate (Avatar Guide)
- `gl-avatar-guide.js` — rule-based engine, 15 triggers, 3 stages (Fan → Bandmate → Coach)
- `gl-avatar-ui.js` — floating 🎸 button + right-side slide-in panel
- Intent layer: `getIntent()` → setup / first_run / improve / prepare / rehearse / idle
- Next Best Action: `getNextBestAction()` → ONE primary action
- Universal CTA: "▶ Run What Matters" (adapts to context)
- Auto-launch: navigates to Play dashboard when ≥3 songs, shows "Let's run one" nudge
- Magic moment: after first playback → "That already sounded tighter"
- Max 2 tips/day, cooldown per tip, dismiss support

### Band Mode (wired from existing systems)
- Play dashboard: Next Action + Scorecard + Listening Card (same as Sharpen/Lock In)
- Go Live + float audio: 🎧 button in Live Gig header toggles GLPlayerUI.showFloat()
- Bidirectional sync: Live Gig nav ↔ audio player
- Quick notes in Go Live (saved to Firebase per setlist)

### Band Scorecard
- Health headline: "The band is getting tighter" / "Holding steady" / "Needs attention"
- Coach line: italic encouragement per state
- Top Focus: amber callout for highest-priority issue
- Strengths: "✔ What's Working" (frequency → quality → timing → readiness)
- Issues: "▶ Focus Here" (clear but encouraging)
- Rating dots: last 5 sessions as emoji trail
- Song movement: locked in / need attention / in progress
- On all three dashboards (Sharpen, Lock In, Play)

### Rehearsal System
- Session lifecycle: Plan → Start → Active (timed) → End → Summary → Save
- Session summary screen: rating (Great/Solid/Needs Work), reflection, notes, mixdown attachment
- Headline insights per session (derived from rating + timing + songs)
- Trend indicator: last 5 ratings + direction
- Mixdown tagging: Best Take / Needs Work
- Delete + bulk delete for past sessions
- Micro-session filtering (< 2min hidden)

### Rehearsal Mixdowns
- Session-level recording archive under Rehearsal page
- Upload MP3, paste Drive link, or direct audio URL
- In-app HTML5 audio player
- One-click Rehearsal Chopper integration
- Linked to sessions via mixdown_id

### Band Feed
- Post types: note, link, photo, idea, poll
- Photo rendering (inline image), link labels (smart domain detection)
- Pin to Band Room (📌)
- Edit posts (inline textarea)
- Single + bulk delete with permissions (creator or admin)
- System filter (⚙️) for auto-generated posts
- Auto-posts suppressed from default "All" view
- Filters: Links, Photos, Pinned, System, Archived

### Progression Tracking
- Action log: practice_set, practice_all, completed_* (14-day localStorage)
- Completion-aware Next Action Card: "✅ Practiced today" (green)
- Progression signals: practice count, rehearsal trend, all songs locked
- Practice streaks (3-day, 5-day)
- Band activity: rehearsal frequency, member count, momentum visual
- Milestones: streaks, all songs ready, 80%+ gig-ready

### Player Confidence
- "Finding best version..." (not "Loading...")
- "Checking YouTube..." (not "Trying YouTube...")
- "✔ Playing: Song Title · YouTube · Best available version"
- "Coming up → Fire on the Mountain"
- "Last song — finish strong"
- Fallback = choice: "Couldn't find a perfect match — Choose how to listen"

### Massive Session (2026-03-25 → 2026-03-27, 63 deploys)

**Infrastructure:**

**Feedback Intelligence V1 (2026-03-28):**
- 5 new modules: gl-user-identity, avatar_feedback_classifier/context/service/summarizer
- Avatar detects feedback keywords → conversational acknowledgment + auto-submit with full context
- Auto-capture: render failure, 3x repeated failure, onboarding stall (deduped per session)
- Admin inbox in Settings → Bugs (list + detail + status management + notes)
- Storage: `/product_feedback/{reportId}` in Firebase
- `GLStore.saveProductFeedback()` API

**Feedback Intelligence V2 (2026-03-28):**
- Issue grouping by `clusterKey` (type + page + keyword) — reduces 10 reports to 1 issue
- Scoring: `(frequency × 2) + severity + flow criticality`, founder reports × 2

**Brian's bugs fixed:** Encore picker, rehearsal plan, home→blank, input contrast, setlist save

### UX/Copy Pass (2026-03-29 — 15+ deploys)

**Home — State-Driven:**
- Dynamic "Next up for your band" card: detects no songs / no setlist / gig imminent / has setlist
- Rehearsal ALWAYS primary when setlist exists (weak songs demoted to secondary)
- Intent buttons (Practice Solo / Rehearse / Play a Gig) are secondary, smaller
- Zero friction: rehearsal starts directly, practice opens first weak song, play launches live
- Avatar hidden when generic, text-only guidance when shown
- No mode-specific dashboards (Sharpen/Lock In/Play unified into one Home)
- `_renderNextUpCard()` + `_renderIntentSection()` + state machine in `_renderNextActionCard()`

**Navigation:**
- Primary: Home, Songs, Rehearsal, Schedule, Setlists (left rail + mobile menu)
- Secondary (collapsed `<details>`): Tools, Band, More
- Mode switcher removed from nav (modes still work internally)
- Calendar → Schedule everywhere

**Setlists — "Build Your Set":**
- All labels updated (Lock This Set, Build a New Set, Add a song, etc.)
- 3-song inline assist, post-save confirmation, "Add to this band" for new songs

**Rehearsal — Plan vs Session:**
- Draft badge, two-button split (Start Band Rehearsal + Open Charts to Practice)
- Guardrail modal before creating real session
- Charts-only practice mode (no session saved)
- "Recreate from Recording" for recovering past sessions
- Separator between draft plan and saved rehearsal history

**Reveal — 4-Block:**
- Headline → Proof → Directive → Confidence Close
- Contextual CTA: detects transition/ending/tempo in issue text
- "Practice That Next" / "Run That Transition Again" / "Practice That Ending"

**Songs — Practice-First:**
- "Work on this next" recommendation with "Practice Now" CTA
- Simplified chips (max 2 per row)
- Band chart primary on Song Detail (external links under "References")
- "Practice This Song" section: Play Along, Learn the Parts, Practice Harmonies, Learn the Lyrics

**Schedule:**
- "Next Up" section: next rehearsal + next gig with availability, readiness, risk
- Action buttons per event type
- All existing calendar/availability features intact

**Test Stabilization:**
- Deterministic flags: `GL_APP_READY`, `GL_PAGE_READY`, `GL_REHEARSAL_READY`
- `GLStore.isBootReady()` added to groovelinx_store.js
- Shared `tests/helpers.js` with `signIn`, `navigateAndWait`, `waitForGlobal`
- Burn-in test suite (`tests/burn-in.spec.js`) — repeated critical flow execution with timing + flag verification
- 0 failed (was 8), 0-7 flaky (was 26), 141 tests total

**Production code changed for tests (minimal):**
- `js/core/groovelinx_store.js`: `isBootReady()` + `GL_APP_READY` flag
- `js/ui/navigation.js`: `GL_PAGE_READY` flag set after renderer completes
- `js/features/rehearsal.js`: `GL_REHEARSAL_READY` flag

### Focus Engine (2026-03-29)

Single source of truth for "what should we work on?" — replaces scattered weak-song calculations.

- **`GLStore.getNowFocus()`** — returns `{ primary, list, reason, count }` (top 5 priority songs)
- Composite scoring: readiness gap × setlist membership × gig urgency × band love priority × active status
- 30-second cache for performance
- All UI consumers wired: Home dashboard (Next Action, Session Plan, Top Songs), Songs page (needs_work filter, suggested next), Rehearsal page (focus songs header)
- Replaces `PracticeAttention` and individual weak-song calculations everywhere

### Band Love + Song Value Model (2026-03-29)

Heart-based song rating (1-5) with derived intelligence — how much the band loves a song vs how ready they are.

- **`GLStore.saveBandLove(songId, value)`** / `getBandLove()` / `getAllBandLove()` — Firebase-persisted
- **`deriveSongStatus(songId)`** — labels: Core Song, Worth the Work, Utility, Shelve Candidate, Solid, Growing, Developing
- **`getSongPriority(songId)`** — `(love * 0.6) + ((5 - readiness) * 0.4)`
- **`getSongGap(songId)`** — emotional gap (love minus readiness) for triage
- **`getSongSignals(songId)`** — full signal bundle for avatar/NBA engine
- **`getRehearsalPriorities(limit)`** — ranked list for rehearsal planning
- **`getBandPreferences()`** — lovedSongs, lowEnergySongs, growthSongs for Band DNA integration
- Song Detail page: `_sdRenderBandLove()` widget with heart rating + derived status badge
- Preloaded 8 seconds after boot via `requestIdleCallback`

### Calendar Locations (2026-03-29)

- Location fields on events: name, address (with Google Maps directions link), venue, meeting link
- **`GLStore.getRehearsalLocations()`** / **`createRehearsalLocation()`** — reusable location picker
- Inline "add new location" form in event creation
- Meet/Zoom link field for virtual rehearsals

### Chart Import (2026-03-29)

- **`/fetch-chart` Worker endpoint** — fetches external chart pages, strips HTML, returns plain text (5KB cap, CORS bypass)
- "Make this your chart" button on external tab links → imports into band chart
- `_sdImportTabAsChart()` opens rehearsal mode with guidance toast

### Songs — Focus Mode (2026-03-29)

- "Get Better" intent button sets `window._glFocusMode=true`
- Songs page filters to focus songs only, shows "What to work on right now" banner
- Exits focus mode on navigation away

### Voice Coach Improvements (2026-03-29)

- Locked Web Speech voice — caches selected voice, never changes mid-session (priority: Samantha, Google US English, Karen, Tessa, Fiona)
- Configurable ElevenLabs voice — `setVoiceId()` / `getVoiceId()` with localStorage persistence
- Async voice preloading for Chrome (`onvoiceschanged` handler)

### New Active Work Docs (2026-03-29)

- `02_GrooveLinx/Active_Work/ChatGPT_UAT_Handoff.md` — ChatGPT UX review handoff (screenshots, prompts, page-by-page eval)
- `02_GrooveLinx/Active_Work/Knowledge_Sync_Protocol.md` — Keeping feature registry + UI contracts in sync after deploys
- `02_GrooveLinx/Active_Work/Video_Recording_Guide.md` — 5 demo clip recording guide (setup, setlist, rehearsal, reveal, avatar)
- `02_GrooveLinx/Active_Work/Website_Rewrite.md` — Full website copy rewrite (8-section structure, removing jam-band language)

### Data Integrity + Dead Code Cleanup (2026-03-30)

Full structural pass — read-path refactor, zero Firebase schema changes.

**Active Status Centralization:**
- `GLStore.ACTIVE_STATUSES` — canonical 6-status set (prospect/learning/rotation/wip/active/gig_ready)
- `GLStore.isActiveSong(title)` — boolean check
- `GLStore.avgReadiness(title)` — exposed (was private)
- Replaced 20+ inline status definitions across 8 files
- **Bug fix:** 4 files had 4-status variant missing `wip`/`active` — songs now visible everywhere

**Duplicate Logic Removed:**
- 3 duplicate weak-song calculators in home-dashboard.js → `GLStore.getNowFocus()`
- 4 inline avg readiness computations → `GLStore.avgReadiness()`
- 10+ direct `statusCache`/`readinessCache` reads in songs.js, song-detail.js → GLStore wrappers

**Critical Fixes:**
- bestshot.js: removed `song.status` mutation on shared `allSongs` object
- song-detail.js: `statusCache` direct mutation → `GLStore.setStatus()` (event bus now fires)
- rehearsal.js: added array bounds check on `item.songs[0]/[1]` access

**Dead Code Removed:**
- app.js: 4 unreachable functions (97 lines) after return in `showBandResources()`
- utils.js: dead `bandKnowledgeBase` code path
- version-hub.js: dead `bandKnowledgeBase` reference

**Silent Failures Fixed:**
- 13 empty catch blocks → `console.warn` with `[Module]` prefix across 6 files

**Infrastructure:**
- index-dev.html: added 12 missing script tags (dev parity with prod)
- Restored playwright.config.js + proper test files (removed " 2" file duplicates)

### Stabilization Pass (2026-03-30)

Race condition fixes — timing and synchronization.

**GL_PAGE_READY Lifecycle (SYSTEM LOCK):**
- `_navSeq` counter in navigation.js prevents stale async renders from setting `GL_PAGE_READY`
- All 7 assignment sites guarded by sequence check
- Stale renders logged: `[Navigation] Stale render skipped`

**focusChanged Event Model (SYSTEM LOCK):**
- `invalidateFocusCache()` emits `'focusChanged'` on GLStore event bus
- Home → `invalidateHomeCache()` when visible
- Songs → `renderSongs()` when visible
- Rehearsal → `renderRehearsalPage()` when visible

**Firebase Error Filtering (SYSTEM LOCK):**
- Suppresses only `firebaseio.com/.lp` long-poll disconnect noise in index.html
- Does NOT suppress real Firebase errors

**Chaos Test Suite:**
- `tests/chaos.spec.js` — 46 tests covering rapid navigation, state mutation stress, cross-surface consistency, data edge cases, rehearsal lifecycle, calendar stability, console error audit, boot readiness

### Repo Hygiene (2026-03-30)

- Deleted 13 items: Archive.zip, NEXT_SESSION.md, fix_cover_me.py, test-results 2-6/, empty dirs, uat054_patch/
- Archived 12 items: ARCHIVED_learning_resources.js, deploy.sh, outputs/, html audits, old session notes
- Moved: docs/song_record_schema.md → 02_GrooveLinx/specs/
- Root directory: 71 → 58 items
- .gitignore: added test-results*/, playwright-report/, archive/

### Rehearsal Analysis Pipeline (2026-03-30)

New module: `js/core/rehearsal-analysis-pipeline.js` (window.RehearsalAnalysis)

- **`run(sessionId, opts)`** — full pipeline: load session → parse notes → segment audio → build story → generate insights → persist to Firebase → emit event
- **`parseNotes(text, songs, members)`** — extracts timestamps, song references, player mentions, issues, positives (word-boundary matching)
- **`generateInsights(params)`** — per-song issues, player feedback, actionable recommendations with type detection (timing/pitch/transition/lyrics/section)
- Triggers: rehearsal-mode.js (after session save), rehearsal.js (after "Recreate from Recording")
- Data stored: `bands/{slug}/rehearsal_sessions/{id}/analysis`
- Session report: structured insights replace raw notes, 0m time breakdown hidden
- Re-run: `run(sessionId, { force: true })` + UI button in session report

### GLInsights — Band Intelligence Engine (2026-03-30)

New module: `js/core/gl-insights.js` (window.GLInsights)

**Persistent Issue Store (Firebase):**
- `bands/{slug}/intelligence/issues/{song}`: totalCount, recentCount, types, sessions, lastSeenAt
- `bands/{slug}/intelligence/sessions/{id}`: analyzedAt, issueCount, songs
- `recordSessionIssues(analysis)` aggregates across sessions
- `loadIssues()` with 30s cache, lazy-loads 5s after boot

**Explainability:**
- `getFocusExplanation(title)` — `{ reason, details[], score }` combining readiness, setlist, issues, priority
- Songs page: explanation dots under "Work on this next"

**Action Engine:**
- `buildActionPlan(title)` — `{ song, problemType, recommendation, actionPlan[], estimatedTime, severity }`
- 7 templates × 2 severity levels (low/high) with bandmate-voice guidance
- Starting anchors, stop conditions, goal lines, conditional branches
- `getFixBlock(limit)` — top N plans for rehearsal agenda
- `getNextAction()` — `{ headline, detail, song, plan, cta }` for Home hero card

**Trend Detection:**
- `getTrend(title)` — improving/flat/worsening across sessions

**Bulk Utility:**
- `reanalyzeAll(onProgress)` — retroactive pipeline for all past sessions

### GrooveMate Intelligence (2026-03-30)

Wired GLInsights into existing GrooveMate guidance system (no new module).

- `buildContext()` enriched with: topIssueSong, topIssueSongCount, topIssueSongTypes, insightAction, weakSongs from focus engine
- 5 new GUIDANCE entries: `insight_top_issue`, `insight_post_rehearsal`, `insight_improving`, `insight_persistent_issue`, `insight_rehearsal_start`
- `getNextBestAction()` upgraded: intelligence-first with type-specific hints
- 4 new triggers: `has_rehearsal_issues`, `just_finished_with_issues`, `trend_improving_with_data`, `persistent_issue`
- Message functions receive context for dynamic personalization

### Unified Guided Home (2026-03-30)

**Single hero card — one message, one CTA, zero competing surfaces:**
- Priority cascade: Setup → Gig today → Intelligence-driven → Schedule urgency → Default
- `_highConfidence` flag: when true, secondary intent buttons hidden entirely
- GLInsights.getNextAction() feeds BOTH hero card AND avatar messages (always match)

**Hero card structure (high confidence):**
- Title: directive headline ("Fix Estimated Prophet")
- Justification: inline reason ("fell apart · gig in 2 days")
- "Quick plan ▼": expandable depth (sub detail → progress → momentum → action plan)
- CTA: single action with time estimate ("▶ Practice Now · ~15 min")

**Hero card structure (low confidence):**
- Directive default messaging ("Run your set to stay tight")
- Intent buttons shown as fallback discovery

**Progress signals:** improving (green) / mixed (amber) / needs work (red)
**Momentum signals:** consecutive session streaks ("🔥 3 solid sessions in a row")

**Removed from Home (redundant):** _renderSessionPlan, _renderWhatToDoNext, _renderLastRehearsalIssues

- Effectiveness aggregation: loads last 50 help outcomes, identifies weak patterns
- `getEffectivenessReport()` for admin review

**Trust + Transparency (2026-03-28):**
- Action plan display: shows numbered steps BEFORE execution
- Step-by-step progress: circles → hourglass → checkmark/cross per step
- Preview mode: impactful actions (imports, bulk ops) show "Do it" / "Cancel" before executing
- Auto-retry: 1 retry on failure, clear message if still fails
- Action history: `/avatar_actions/{bandId}/{id}` stores every action with timestamp
- Standardized tool results: all tools return `{ success, message, retryable }`
- Result summary: green/red card with what changed + next suggested action

**Self-Improving Loop (2026-03-28):**
- Fix validation: `markClusterFixed()` snapshots count → `validateFix()` compares post-fix reports → resolved/improving/regressed
- Product health API: `getProductHealth()` returns total/open/clusters/flowBreaks/topIssues
- UAT Dashboard: Settings → UAT tab — summary cards + top issues + system status
- GLPlans: added `getCurrentPlan()`, `isFounder()`, `activateFounderCode()` (were missing)
- Billing: Plan tab visible, founder code entry works, plan badge correct

**GLOrchestrator (2026-03-28):**
- `gl-orchestrator.js` — central control engine for user experience
- `getNextAction(ctx)` — determines next best action based on onboarding state, songs, setlists, page
- `shouldIntervene(ctx)` — checks if avatar should proactively help
- `getMessage(ctx)` — personality-adjusted message with action + urgency
- 4 personality modes: guide (supportive), coach (prescriptive), analyst (data-driven), fixer (action-first)
- Mode auto-selected from avatar stage + friction clusters
- Autopilot: checks on page change, shows toast for high-urgency suggestions
- Avatar panel: falls back to orchestrator when no guidance tip available

**GLTaskEngine (2026-03-28):**
- `gl-task-engine.js` — strict execution pipeline replacing direct tool calls
- Pipeline: `plan(intent)` → `needsConfirmation(plan)` → `execute(plan)` → `verify(result)` → `explain(result)`
- Plan templates for all 9 intents with risk assessment (low/medium) + base confidence
- Auto-retry on failure (1 retry per step)
- Partial success supported (some steps succeed, others fail)
- Verification: confirms each step result is valid
- Explanation: structured summary + next action suggestion
- All tasks logged to Firebase `/avatar_tasks/{bandId}/{taskId}`
- Avatar wired: TaskEngine used when available, falls back to old ActionRouter

**Trusted Operator (2026-03-28):**
- Dynamic confidence: `getDynamicConfidence(intent)` adjusts based on success rate + undo rate from localStorage history
- Undo system: `_snapshotBeforeTask()` captures song IDs + setlist state → `undoLastTask()` rolls back
- Undo button shown on medium/high risk completed actions
- Task learning: every run records `{ runs, success, failures, undos }` per intent
- Confidence formula: `base * 0.4 + successRate * 0.5 - undoRate * 0.3` (range 0.3-0.98)
- After 3+ runs of an intent, confidence is data-driven instead of static

**Anticipatory Bandmate (2026-03-28):**
- Band DNA: persistent profile `{ strengths, weaknesses, tendencies, improvementVelocity, ratings, sessionCount }`
- Updated after every rehearsal via `GLStore.on('agendaSessionCompleted')`
- Stored in localStorage + mirrored to Firebase `/bands/{slug}/band_dna`
- Anticipation engine: checks on every page change
  - Post-rehearsal → suggests scheduling next rehearsal
  - Songs but no setlist → suggests building one
  - Improvement velocity > 0.3 → acknowledges progress
  - Velocity < -0.3 → suggests focus on weakest song
- Auto-workflow: rehearsal completion auto-updates Band DNA + completes flow tracking
- All anticipation actions deduped per session (no spam)

**GrooveMate Actions V1 (2026-03-28):**
- Action router: 10 intents detected from voice/text (add_song, import_artist_pack, create_setlist, add_chart_note, etc.)
- Tool registry: 9 deterministic tools (addSong, bulkAddSongs, importArtistPack, createSetlist, addChartNote, suggestSections, attachChartSource, saveRehearsalNote)
- 13 curated artist packs (Billy Joel, Elton John, Dead, Phish, Beatles, Wedding, WSP, Allman, Goose, DMB, Campfire, Worship, Standards)
- Chart notes with auto-typed categories (arrangement, vocal, instrumental, transition, performance)
- Section assistant: standard structure suggestions (Intro→Verse→Chorus→Bridge→Solo→Outro)
- Source link attachment with auto-detected labels (UG, Chordify, YouTube, etc.)
- Action receipts: success summary + next action suggestion button
- No protected chart content copying — links and annotations only
- ElevenLabs TTS live (Worker proxy), Cloudflare AI binding active (Flux)
- Product feedback system live — users can report via avatar, auto-capture on friction
- Band creation has 8 types with subtypes (multi-step wizard)
- GLStore.ready() dependency gating deployed
- Global error capture + render logging on all pages
- Founder UAT in progress — Drew walking through test manual

Priorities:
1. Founder UAT — test remaining sections (2-10) in Founder Test Manual
2. Brian's 4/1 rehearsal test — fix any issues reported
3. Demo video clips for website
4. Real user testing with non-founder bands
5. Venue Google Places autocomplete
6. Stripe payment integration
```

## Firebase Paths

```
bands/{slug}/feed_meta/{type:id}         — feed overlay (archive, resolved, tags, notes, pinned)
bands/{slug}/push_subscriptions/{key}     — push subscription per member
bands/{slug}/metrics/{key}/{date}         — daily usage rollup per member
bands/{slug}/rehearsal_sessions/{id}      — session summaries (rating, notes, mixdown_id, blocks)
bands/{slug}/rehearsal_mixdowns/{id}      — mixdown recordings (audio_url, drive_url)
bands/{slug}/live_gig_notes/{setlistId}   — quick notes from Go Live
bands/{slug}/songs/{title}/curation       — per-song version curation (spotify/youtube/archive)
```

## Product Principles

- "Needs You" not "I Owe" — collaborative, not transactional
- Feed = control tower. One brain, not a collection of tools.
- Listening = fewest clicks to the right music in the right place.
- Every flow must end in a visible state — never a silent dead-end.
- Playback within 60 seconds of first interaction.
- GrooveMate guides without interrupting.
- One primary action at a time. No ambiguity.
- "Run What Matters" — universal CTA that adapts to context.
