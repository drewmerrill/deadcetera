# 🎚️ HOW TO ADD MOISES STEMS - Instructions for Chris

Hey Chris! Here's how to add your Moises stems to songs in the app:

---

## STEP 1: Upload Stems to Google Drive

1. **Create a folder in Google Drive** for the song
   - Example: "Fire on the Mountain - Moises Stems"

2. **Upload all your separated tracks** to that folder:
   - Bass track
   - Drums track
   - Guitar track
   - Keys track
   - Vocals track
   - Any other stems

3. **Share the folder** with the band:
   - Right-click folder → Share
   - Add: drewmerrill1029@gmail.com, pierce.d.hale@gmail.com, brian@hrestoration.com, cmjalbert@gmail.com, jnault@fegholdings.com
   - Give them "Viewer" or "Editor" access

4. **Get the folder link:**
   - Right-click folder → Get link
   - Copy the URL
   - Should look like: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TsGjHAqAbvc_6MbARAQ-cGMhdGip9LnX`

## STEP 2: Get Individual File Links (Optional)

For each stem file you want to make downloadable:

1. **Right-click the file** in Drive
2. **Get link**
3. **Copy the URL**
4. Should look like: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U15OOxCLwKC98F5K-Hc2jGt8eZMZ98or/view`

Repeat for each stem (bass, drums, guitar, keys, vocals)

3. **Select your song** (e.g., "Fire on the Mountain")

4. **Scroll down to "🎚️ Moises Stems (Practice Parts)" section**

5. **Click "+ Add Stems"** (if nothing there yet) or **"Edit"** (if stems exist)

6. **Fill in the prompts:**
   
   **Prompt 1:** Google Drive folder URL
   ```
   Paste: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/YOUR_FOLDER_ID
   ```

   ```
   Example: All stems separated from Moises - great for bass practice
   ```

7. **Done!** The stems are now saved and everyone in the band can see them.

## WHAT THE BAND WILL SEE:

After you add stems, everyone will see:

```
🎚️ Moises Stems (Practice Parts)
Source: 11/3/1985 Richmond

[🎸 Bass]     [🥁 Drums]     [🎸 Guitar]
[🎹 Keys]     [🎤 Vocals]

[📁 Open Google Drive Folder]

Notes: All stems separated from Moises - great for bass practice
```

They can:
- Click individual stems to download
- Click "Open Google Drive Folder" to see all files
- Practice with isolated tracks

---

## QUICK METHOD (Just Folder Link):

If you don't want to get individual file links:

1. Upload stems to Drive folder
2. Share with band
3. Get folder link
4. In app: Click song → Add Stems → Paste folder URL
5. Hit Enter through the individual track prompts (leave blank)
6. Done!

Band members can open the folder and download what they need.

---

## TIPS:

- **Folder link is required** - this is where band finds all stems
- **Individual track links are optional** - nice to have but not required
- **You can edit stems later** - just click "Edit" button
- **Saves to Google Drive** - everyone in the band sees the same stems
- **Best practice:** Name your Drive folder clearly (e.g., "Fire on the Mountain - 5/8/77 - Moises Stems")
