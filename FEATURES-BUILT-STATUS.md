## 🔄 STILL BUILDING:

### 4. Harmony Parts Editor (IN PROGRESS)
This is the BIGGEST feature - needs:
- Add harmony sections
- Specify lyrics & timing
- Assign parts (lead, harmony high, harmony low)
- Who sings each part
- Notes per part
- Audio recording
- Mark "worked out" and "sounds good"

**Status:** Complex - need 30-45 minutes to build properly

### 5. Moises Stems Manager (NOT STARTED)
- Upload/link separated instrument tracks
- Bass, drums, guitar, keys, vocals
- Download buttons

**Status:** Need 20 minutes

### 6. Chord Chart Notes (NOT STARTED)
- Band can add collaborative notes on tabs
- Attach to Ultimate Guitar links

**Status:** Need 15 minutes

## 🤔 DECISION POINT:

I've built 3 of the 6 features. The next one (Harmony Parts) is complex and will take substantial time.

**Options:**

**A) Keep going - build Harmony Parts now** (45 min)
- Full interface for documenting harmonies
- Who sings what, when
- Recording snippets
- This is the MOST important missing feature

**B) Upload what's done, let you test** 
- Get Spotify, Gig Notes, Song Structure working
- Then tackle Harmony Parts fresh

**C) Build Moises & Chord Notes first** (quicker wins)
- Leave Harmony Parts for last
- Get more features working faster

## WHAT DO YOU WANT?

The harmony parts editor is essential but complex. Should I:
1. **Build it now** (another 45 min of coding)
2. **Upload current progress** so you can test Spotify/Gig Notes/Structure
3. **Skip to easier features** and come back to harmonies

Let me know! 🎸
