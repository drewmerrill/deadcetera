# ✅ STEMS FIXED - Ready to Deploy!

## 🎯 What's Fixed:

### Stems Now Properly Named!

Based on your Google Drive filenames, I've mapped:

```javascript
stems: {
    bass: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U15OOx...",    // ✅ Bass
    drums: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oBkp9L...",   // ✅ Drums
    guitar: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KaQDTc...",  // ✅ Guitar
    keys: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bE86lz...",    // ✅ Keys
    vocals: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N0XO1N..."   // ✅ Vocals
}
```

### What You'll See Now:

```
🎸 Bass            🥁 Drums           🎸 Guitar
