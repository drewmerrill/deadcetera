3. **Find your perfect tab** on Ultimate Guitar
4. **Copy the FULL URL** from the browser
   ```
   https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/grateful-dead/fire-on-the-mountain-chords-77504
   ```
5. **Paste it in the "Tab URL" field**

### Example:

**Drew adds a tab:**
```
Tab URL: https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/grateful-dead/terrapin-station-chords-1134539
Notes: Use this one - has all the chord changes marked
```
