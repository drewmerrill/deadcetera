# 📤 HOW TO UPLOAD MOISES STEMS - Super Easy! (v4.0)

Hey Chris! Good news - you can now upload stems **directly from the app!** No more manual Drive folder creation!

---

## NEW SIMPLIFIED WORKFLOW:

### STEP 1: Prepare Your Files

Make sure your Moises stem files are named clearly:
- `bass.mp3`
- `drums.mp3`
- `guitar.mp3`
- `keys.mp3`
- `vocals.mp3`

(The app will auto-detect instruments from filenames!)

---

### STEP 2: Upload from App

1. **Go to** https://drewmerrill.github.io/deadcetera/

2. **Sign in to Google Drive** (green button at top if not connected)

3. **Click on your song** (e.g., "Fire on the Mountain")

4. **Scroll to "🎚️ Moises Stems (Practice Parts)"**

5. **Click "📤 Upload Stems from Computer"**

6. **Fill in the form:**
   - **Source Version:** (optional) e.g., "Cornell 5/8/77" or "Studio version"
   - **Select Files:** Click and select all your stem files
   - **Notes:** (optional) e.g., "Bass is really clear in this version"

7. **Click "📤 Upload Stems"**

8. **Wait for progress bar** - shows upload status

9. **Done!** ✅

## WHAT HAPPENS AUTOMATICALLY:

When you click upload, the app:

✅ Creates a Drive folder named "[Song Name] - Moises Stems"
✅ Uploads all your files to that folder
✅ Organizes them by instrument (auto-detects from filename)
✅ Creates download links for each stem
✅ Shares folder with the whole band
✅ Everyone can instantly access the stems

---

## WHAT THE BAND SEES:

After you upload, everyone will see:

```
🎚️ Moises Stems (Practice Parts)
Source: Cornell 5/8/77

[🎸 Bass]     [🥁 Drums]     [🎸 Guitar]
[🎹 Keys]     [🎤 Vocals]

[📁 Open Google Drive Folder]

Notes: Bass is really clear in this version
```

They can click any stem to download it instantly!

## TIPS FOR FILE NAMING:

The app auto-detects instruments from filenames. Use these keywords:

- **bass** → Goes to Bass button
- **drum** → Goes to Drums button  
- **guitar** → Goes to Guitar button
- **key** or **piano** → Goes to Keys button
- **vocal** or **voice** → Goes to Vocals button
- Anything else → Goes to "Other" button

**Examples:**
- `bass_track.mp3` ✅
- `Fire_on_Mountain_bass.wav` ✅
- `FotM-bass-isolated.m4a` ✅
- `track_1.mp3` → Will go to "Other" (no keyword)

---

## STILL HAVE STEMS IN DRIVE ALREADY?

If you already uploaded stems to Drive manually, you can still use them!

Click "paste Drive links" instead of "Upload Stems" and enter the folder URL like before.

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING:

**"Upload failed"**
- Make sure you're signed into Google Drive (green checkmark at top)
- Make sure your internet connection is good
- Try refreshing the page and uploading again

**"Files uploading slowly"**
- Large files take time (5-10 MB files might take 30-60 seconds each)
- Don't close the browser while uploading
- Progress bar shows you which file is uploading

**"Can't find my uploaded stems"**
- Check the song's Moises section
- Click "📁 Open Google Drive Folder" to see all files
- Files are in: Shared Band Folder → "[Song Name] - Moises Stems"
